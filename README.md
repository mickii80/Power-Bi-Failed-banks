# Power-Bi-Failed-banks

I created a interactive dashboard with power BI to show data about failed banks at the EE.UU.

This project with Power BI gave me better understanding of how end-to-end solutions can be designed. I learned how to load data with Power BI Desktop, how to use some basic DAX, and create amazing visualizations on your data. Power BI is an impressive, one-stop reporting and analytical tool. You can connect and shape your data, as well as build reporting solutions that help drive decision making.

Key skills I learned: 
✔️ Connect and organize your data
✔️ Create data cleansing processes in Power BI
✔️ Organize your data model
✔️ DAX Basics
✔️ Build Interactive Reports
✔️ Deploy and share your solution
